  # XXX TODO: If Boa ever supports conda-build's "pin_depends: strict" here¹, I
  # think it could replace our entire two-pass build process!  Unfortunately,
  # conda-build is so much slower than Boa that the more complicated build
  # process is worth it.

  summary: Base Nextstrain runtime (meta-package)
  description: >
    This meta-package depends on all the other packages needed for a base
    Nextstrain runtime installed as a Conda environment.  As the
    nextstrain/base image is to Nextstrain CLI's Docker runtime, this
    nextstrain-base package is to Nextstrain CLI's Conda runtime.

    - python < 3.11
    
    #
    # First-party
    #
    # XXX TODO: Install Next{align,clade} v1 alongside v2 like the Docker
    # runtime does?  Unclear how to do this in Conda without creating entirely
    # separate packages (e.g. nextalign1 and nextalign2).
    # XXX TODO: Include fauna?
    #
    - augur
    - auspice
    - evofr
    - nextalign
    - nextclade
    - nextstrain-cli

    #
    # Third-party
    #
    # XXX TODO: Pin some of these to the same versions the Docker runtime uses?
    # XXX TODO: No package available for Python envdir package.
    # XXX TODO: No package available for less.
    # XXX TODO: Omits pysam… but it may be unnecessary in the Docker runtime?
    # XXX TODO: Omits pango-designation… but it may be unnecessary in the Docker runtime?
    #
    # Include bash so that a newer version is guaranteed to be available on
    # systems with an older bash.  This is similar to how our Docker runtime
    # image includes its own bash too.
