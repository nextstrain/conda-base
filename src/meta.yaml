    # Include bash so that a newer version is guaranteed to be available on
    # systems with an older bash.  This is similar to how our Docker runtime
    # image includes its own bash too.

    # Avoid versions of c-ares that require glibc ≥2.28, a change introduced in
    # 1.33.0¹ and reverted in a revision to 1.34.3².
    #
    # Note that using run_constrained doesn't work (at least on the face of
    # it), potentially (?) because of our two-step build process.
